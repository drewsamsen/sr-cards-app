UI refinements have been made to improve user experience, including better mobile responsiveness through the phone emulator, simplified forms, and clearer button terminology. The About page has been added to provide context and information about the app.

The focus has shifted from core functionality implementation to UI/UX improvements and content organization. Recent work has concentrated on making the application more intuitive and visually appealing while maintaining its functionality.

## Known Issues
- Some loading skeletons may still need additional refinement
- Form validation could be more robust
- Error handling needs to be more user-friendly
- Performance optimizations needed for larger deck/card collections

## Success Metrics
- Complete study system with FSRS algorithm is functional
- UI components and layouts are responsive in both desktop and phone views
- Phone emulator provides accurate representation of mobile experience
- About page provides clear context about the application
- Visual consistency is maintained across the application

## Next Milestone
