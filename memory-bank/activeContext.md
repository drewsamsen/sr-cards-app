- Adding explanatory content about the application
- Refining user interactions for common tasks
- Ensuring consistent terminology throughout the UI

## Next Steps
1. Complete any remaining visual refinements
2. Enhance consistency in loading states
3. Review and update all instructional text
4. Improve feedback mechanisms for user actions
5. Consider adding additional onboarding guidance

## Active Decisions
- **Loading Skeleton Improvements**:
  - Reduced width and complexity of loading skeletons in phone mode
  - Showing fewer elements and rows in phone mode skeletons
  - Simplified table headers and action buttons in loading state
  - Made loading skeletons accurately reflect actual loaded content
  - Created consistent styling approach for all loading states
- **About Page Structure**:
  - Used static content rather than collapsible sections for clarity
  - Organized content in logical sections (What is EchoCards, How it Works, etc.)
  - Included technology stack details with GitHub links
  - Added section about how the app was developed
  - Used consistent styling with the rest of the application
- **Button Terminology**:
  - Changed "Learn" to "Review" to better reflect the activity
  - Ensured consistent color schemes for action buttons
  - Maintaining color coding for different response buttons (Again, Hard, Good, Easy)
- **Phone Emulator Interface**:
  - Repositioned toggle buttons for better accessibility
  - Improved toggle UI to show both options clearly
  - Maintained consistent behavior across the application
- **Form Simplification**:
  - Removed unnecessary placeholder text
  - Maintained clear labels while reducing clutter
  - Improved loading state visualization during demo login
- **UI Framework**: Using Shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Data Management**: Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- **Routing**: Using Next.js App Router for page routing
- **Authentication**: Implementing user account-based authentication
- **API Structure**: RESTful service pattern for backend communication

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent visual design across all components
- Creating an intuitive and accessible interface for all users
- Balancing information density with clarity
- Ensuring responsive design works well in both native and emulated phone views
- Maintaining visual hierarchy in different screen sizes

## User Feedback Priorities
- Intuitive navigation and interface
- Clear explanation of application purpose
- Consistent visual design
- Responsive and accessible interface
- Fast and reliable performance

## Development Focus
The primary development focus has shifted from core functionality implementation to refinement and user experience improvements. The priority is on creating a polished, intuitive interface that presents the application's functionality in a clear and approachable manner.
