# Flashcard Review App - Project Intelligence

## Coding Patterns

### Component Structure
- Components are organized by feature (cards, decks) and common UI elements
- Modal components handle their own state and use a consistent pattern
- Table components use Tanstack Table with custom columns and cell renderers
- Form components use controlled inputs with validation

### Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for component names: `CardEditModal`, `DeckColumns`
- camelCase for functions and variables: `useCards`, `handleSearch`
- kebab-case for CSS classes: `data-table`, `card-content`
- snake_case for API fields: `review_at`, `created_at`

### File Organization
- Components are in `/src/components/`
- Pages are in `/src/app/` following Next.js App Router convention
- Utilities and hooks are in `/src/lib/`
- API services are in `/src/lib/api/services/`

### State Management
- Custom hooks for domain data: `useAuth()`, `useCards()`
- Component state for UI: `useState` for modals, forms, etc.
- Context API for global state: authentication

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling
- Shadcn UI components as base components
- Consistent spacing and color usage
- Dark/light mode support via theme context

## Development Workflow

### Component Development
1. Create UI structure with Shadcn components
2. Add state management and event handlers
3. Implement API integration if needed
4. Add responsive styling with Tailwind
5. Implement loading, error, and empty states

### Feature Implementation
1. Define data models and API services
2. Create custom hooks for data management
3. Build UI components
4. Implement routing and navigation
5. Add error handling and loading states

### Common Patterns
- Modal dialogs for focused tasks (adding/editing)
- Table layouts for data presentation
- Form components for data input
- Alert components for notifications
- Loading skeletons for data fetching states

## Project-Specific Knowledge

### Key Implementation Paths
- Authentication flow: `useAuth` hook → `src/app/login` → protected routes
- Card management: `useCards` hook → `CardAddModal`/`CardEditModal` → `DataTable`
- Deck management: Similar pattern to cards with deck-specific components
- Study system: FSRS algorithm implementation (in progress)

### Critical Files
- `src/lib/api/client.ts`: API client configuration
- `src/components/header.tsx`: Main navigation
- `src/components/data-table.tsx`: Reusable table component
- `src/lib/hooks/useAuth.ts`: Authentication state management
- `src/lib/hooks/useCards.ts`: Card data management

### Preferred Approaches
- Use existing Shadcn UI components when available
- Follow established patterns for new features
- Maintain type safety with TypeScript
- Use custom hooks for data management
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities
